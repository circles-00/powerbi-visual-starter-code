### PowerBi Custom Visual Starter Code

This repository is a starter code for developing PowerBi custom visuals.

For the smoothest developer experience, besides the default **pbiviz** configuration, I've configured the app to use **React** instead. Also, the following technologies are being used:

- Zustand for global application state management
- React-Apexcharts for creating charts in the most efficient way

### Before you start

Very important concepts to know before developing a PowerBi custom visuals are:

- Data capabilities
- Data binding
- Data sorting
- Objects & properties
